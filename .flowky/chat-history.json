As an AI assistant, I can't modify your files directly, but I can give you the exact steps and explanations to do it yourself.\n\nAdding your `.env` files to `.gitignore` is a critical security practice to prevent secrets and credentials from being committed to your repository.\n\n### 1. Edit your `.gitignore` file\n\nOpen the `.gitignore` file located in the root of your project. If you don't have one, create it.\n\nAdd the following lines to the file. The comment helps explain why these files are being ignored.\n\n```gitignore\n# Environment variables\n# Do not commit sensitive keys, passwords, or other credentials\n.env\n.env.*\n!/.env.example\n```\n\n**Explanation of each line:**\n\n*   `# Environment variables`: This is a comment, making your `.gitignore` file easier to read.\n*   `.env`: This ignores the main `.env` file.\n*   `.env.*`: This is a wildcard pattern that ignores any file starting with `.env.`, such as `.env.local`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production`.\n*   `!/.env.example`: This is an important exception. The `!` negates the pattern, meaning it will *not* be ignored. It's a common practice to commit a template or example file (`.env.example`) that shows other developers what variables are needed for the project, but without any sensitive values.\n\n### 2. What if you've already committed `.env` files?\n\nIf you have already accidentally committed a `.env` file to your repository, simply adding it to `.gitignore` is not enough. Git will continue to track the file because it's already in the history.\n\nYou need to tell Git to stop tracking the file. Run the following command for each file you need to remove from the repository.\n\n**This command will remove the file from Git's tracking, but it will leave the file on your local machine.**\n\n```bash\n# To remove a single .env file\ngit rm --cached .env\n\n# To remove all files matching the .env.* pattern\ngit rm --cached .env.*\n```\n\nAfter running the `git rm --cached` command, commit the change:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Stop tracking .env files\"\ngit push\n```\n\n**⚠️ Important Security Warning:**\nIf you have pushed a commit containing your `.env` file to a remote repository (like GitHub), you must consider those secrets **compromised**. They are now in your Git history. You should immediately:\n1.  Rotate all credentials (API keys, database passwords, etc.) found in that file.\n2.  Consider using a tool like the [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to remove the sensitive data from your entire Git history.",

Here is a complete, step-by-step guide to push your local code to that new GitHub repository for the first time.\n\nI'll walk you through initializing your local repository (if you haven't already), committing your files, connecting to the GitHub URL, and pushing the code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\nFollow these commands in your project's root terminal.\n\n#### Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository\n\nIf you haven't already created a Git repository in your project folder, run this command. If you've already done this, it's safe to run again—it won't overwrite anything.\n\n```bash\ngit init\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Add Your Files to Staging\n\nThis command stages all your files (including the `.gitignore` you just configured) to be included in the first commit. The `.` stands for the current directory.\n\n```bash\ngit add .\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Make Your First Commit\n\nThis command saves your staged files into the local repository's history. The message `\"Initial commit\"` is a common convention for the first one.\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Set Your Branch Name to `main` (Best Practice)\n\nGitHub's default branch is now `main`. This command ensures your local branch is also named `main` to avoid any mismatches.\n\n```bash\ngit branch -M main\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Add the Remote Repository\n\nThis is where you tell your local Git repository where to push the code. You are linking your local project to the URL you provided. We'll give it the standard name `origin`.\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/Domination-Media/rawfin.git\n```\n\n**To verify it was added correctly**, you can run:\n`git remote -v`\nYou should see your URL listed for both `fetch` and `push`.\n\n#### Step 6: Push Your Code to GitHub\n\nThis is the final step. It sends your committed code from your local `main` branch to the `origin` remote repository on GitHub.\n\n*   The `-u` flag sets the upstream tracking reference. You only need to do this the *first time* you push. After this, you can just use `git push`.\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n### What to Expect Next\n\n*   **Authentication:** When you run the `git push` command, your terminal will likely ask you to authenticate with GitHub. You may need to enter your username and a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**, not your regular password.\n*   **Success!** Once authenticated, you'll see output in your terminal indicating the objects are being written and pushed to the repository.\n*   **Check GitHub:** Refresh your repository page at `https://github.com/Domination-Media/rawfin.git`, and you will see all your project files.\n\n### All Commands Together (For easy copy-paste)\n\n```bash\n# Only run if you haven't already\ngit init\n\n# Add, commit, and set branch name\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit branch -M main\n\n# Connect to the remote and push\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/Domination-Media/rawfin.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```",
